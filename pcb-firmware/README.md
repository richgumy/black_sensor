## Sub-directory for all EIT firmware ##

All embedded firmware currently runs on an ESP32 microcontroller (other models like ESP32-S3/C3 etc. are untested)

Note: Ensure all when building through esp-idf that the folder is in a directory path with no spaces!


This dir also includes the program for the Cartesian force applicator ```eit_cfa_read.py``` and other various data processing tools in the ```pcb_mux``` directory
