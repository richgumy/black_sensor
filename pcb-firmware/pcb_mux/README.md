# _PCB MUX with SMU_

Code to multiplex a current source and voltage measurements for Electrical Impedance Tomography using an adjacent electrode current injection pattern. 

## The process
Each iteration of the injection pattern is trigged externally by a ?? edge. This will be driven by the SMU taking the measruements so that as soon as sufficient measurements have been taken the next step in the injection pattern will be executed.
